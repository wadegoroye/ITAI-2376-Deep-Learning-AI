Before his presidency, he played a crucial role in the American Revolutionary War as the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His leadership was pivotal in achieving American independence from British rule. Washington's presidency set many precedents for the national government and the future officeholders. His decision to voluntarily step down after two terms established a standard for presidential tenure, promoting the democratic principle of leadership transition. Washington's policies and actions during his presidency helped lay the foundational structure of the new government, shaping the path for the future of the United States [1] [2] [3].\n","\n","Sources:\n","[1] George Washington – https://www.thenmusa.org/biographies/george-washington/ (2025-05-07)\n","[2] George Washington | Life, Presidency, Accomplishments, & ... – https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Washington (2025-05-07)\n","[3] Biography of George Washington – https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/biography (2025-05-07)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import ipywidgets as widgets\n","from IPython.display import display, clear_output\n","import traceback\n","import threading\n","import time\n","from functools import lru_cache\n","\n","# Cache for search and LLM results\n","search_cache = {}\n","llm_cache = {}\n","\n","# Wrapper for chat to apply optimizations\n","def optimized_chat(msgs, T=0.5, retries=3):\n","    # Cache key based on messages\n","    cache_key = str(msgs)\n","    if cache_key in llm_cache:\n","        return llm_cache[cache_key]\n","\n","    # Reduce max_tokens for faster response\n","    for _ in range(retries):\n","        try:\n","            r = client.chat.completions.create(\n","                model=\"itai-2376\",\n","                messages=msgs,\n","                max_tokens=256,  # Reduced from 512\n","                temperature=T,   # Lowered from 0.7\n","                top_p=1.0\n","            )\n","            result = r.choices[0].message.content\n","            llm_cache[cache_key] = result\n","            return result\n","        except RateLimitError as e:\n","            time.sleep(getattr(e, \"retry_after\", 2))  # Reduced from 5\n","    raise RuntimeError(\"LLM rate-limit\")\n","\n","# Parallel search wrapper\n","def parallel_search(q: str, k: int = 3):\n","    cache_key = f\"{q}_{k}\"\n","    if cache_key in search_cache:\n","        return search_cache[cache_key]\n","\n","    results = []\n","    def run_serp():\n","        serp_results = serp_search(q, k)\n","        if serp_results:\n","            results.append((\"SerpAPI\", serp_results))\n","\n","    def run_ddg():\n","        ddg_results = ddg_search(q, k)\n","        if ddg_results:\n","            results.append((\"DuckDuckGo\", ddg_results))\n","\n","    # Run searches in parallel\n","    threads = [\n","        threading.Thread(target=run_serp),\n","        threading.Thread(target=run_ddg)\n","    ]\n","    for t in threads:\n","        t.start()\n","    for t in threads:\n","        t.join()\n","\n","    # Format results\n","    today = datetime.date.today().isoformat()\n","    if results:\n","        # Prefer SerpAPI if available, else use DuckDuckGo\n","        source_type, hit = results[0]\n","        print(f\"🔍 {source_type} hit\")\n","        formatted = \"\\n\".join(f\"[{i}] {h['title']} – {h['url']} ({today})\"\n","                            for i, h in enumerate(hit, 1))\n","        search_cache[cache_key] = formatted\n","        return formatted\n","    formatted = f\"[1] No results found ({today})\"\n","    search_cache[cache_key] = formatted\n","    return formatted\n","\n","# Optimized research wrapper\n","def optimized_research(question: str, max_turns: int = 6):\n","    cache_key = question\n","    if cache_key in search_cache:\n","        return search_cache[cache_key]\n","\n","    msgs = [\n","        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\":\n","         (\"First output SEARCH:<keywords>.
